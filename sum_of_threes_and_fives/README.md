# Sum of Threes and Fives

### Problem
```
Sum Multiples of Three and Five

Given a number n, write a method that sums all multiples of three and five up to n (inclusive).
```

### Feature Request Suggestions
* Change the numbers to something else
* Make it non-inclusive
---
note: I do not suggest using this one. It is confusing. 
There is ambiguity if it is looking for the sum of the multiples of 3 and the multiples of 5 or the sum of numbers that are a multiple of both 3 and 5 ie 15.
The solution is writen for the first option and could easily be adopted to find the sum of 15s. 
On top of that, the math is optimized for adding up sums of sequential numbers, something that is not necessarily straight forward. The tutorial I looked up was even wrong.
